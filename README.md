## About The Project

This is a landing page for a company called EroSoft. It was made with Next.js and TailwindCSS.

This project was my first project that was for production.I still had very little knowledge and experience with React and Next.js, so the code is not good. 

I used Next.js to make the project, but in the end I didn't use SSR or other features of Next.js, so I could have done it with pure React. As I had no experience with React, I didn't know that. This ended up making it difficult to deploy the project, because it would have to run on a Windows server, through IIS. And to make it work was very complicated.

The only reason I used Next.js was to use the api function, which I used to make the contact form.

The site would also have a functionality to modify the services the company offers, receiving data from an external API. The implementation of this functionality was done but the result was not good.
